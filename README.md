# nonconvex_restartingAG

The manual for the package can be found [here](/nonconvex_restartingAG/README.md).

The paper related material can be found [here](/paper). All the codes and outputs (both intermediate outputs and final outputs) can be found [here](/paper/simulation_study). All the results were ran on Compute Canada. The two original Jupyter notebooks are [simulation study for SCAD/MCP-penalized linear models](/paper/simulation_study/LM_SCAD_MCP_cp%20(cupy).ipynb) and [simulation study for SCAD/MCP-penalized logistic models](/paper/simulation_study/logistic_SCAD_MCP_cp%20(cupy).ipynb). To run on the server, I divided the codes into several chunks, they were in [this folder](/paper/simulation_study/tasks). The R codes and results for `ncvreg` simulation can be found [here](/paper/simulation_study/SCAD_MCP) -- click [here for penalized linear models](/paper/simulation_study/SCAD_MCP/LM) or [here for logistic models](/paper/simulation_study/SCAD_MCP/logistic).
