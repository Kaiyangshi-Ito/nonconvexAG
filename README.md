This repository contains simulation study results for [my paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10629). The paper related material can be found [here](/paper). All the codes and outputs (both intermediate outputs and final outputs) can be found [here](/paper/simulation_study). All the results were ran on Compute Canada. The summary of the simulation results is [here](/paper/simulation_study/summary.ipynb), where most of the simulation study results from the paper are from. The two original Jupyter notebooks are [simulation study for SCAD/MCP-penalized linear models](/paper/simulation_study/LM_SCAD_MCP_cp%20(cupy).ipynb) and [simulation study for SCAD/MCP-penalized logistic models](/paper/simulation_study/logistic_SCAD_MCP_cp%20(cupy).ipynb). To run on the server, I divided the codes into several chunks, they were in [this folder](/paper/simulation_study/tasks) -- [task1](/paper/simulation_study/tasks/task1) and [task2](/paper/simulation_study/tasks/task2) contains files to test signal recovery performance for SCAD/MCP-penalized linear models and logistic models using AG; [task1speed](/paper/simulation_study/tasks/task1speed) and [task2speed](/paper/simulation_study/tasks/task2speed) contains files to test convergence speed and computing times for SCAD/MCP-penalized linear models and logistic models using AG v.s. ISTA and coordinate descent;. The R codes and results for `ncvreg` simulation can be found [here](/paper/simulation_study/SCAD_MCP) -- click [here for penalized linear models](/paper/simulation_study/SCAD_MCP/LM) or [here for logistic models](/paper/simulation_study/SCAD_MCP/logistic).

The manual for the package can be found [here](/nonconvex_restartingAG/README.md).
